# LortiUI_Classic3.3.5

LortiUI from classic backported to 3.3.5

this version has a GUI
i just deleted gloss on button since it doesn't work and i don't think it's possible on 3.3.5. the rest works. not sure for Flat HP/mana since i use blp files which has already flat textures
- Hotkeys works
- Macro text works
- blizzard's buff timer position works
- Thick frames (like EasyFrames and UnitFramesImproved addon) works
- Class colored works
- Class portraits works
- Flat HP/mana not sure but no error atleast
- Hit indicator on PlayerFrame works
- Hide actionbar/menu/bags background works
- Red Health for enemies and mobs works (but i didn't test on a player enemy) i even fixed a bug when a mob is tagged it wasn't grey, now it works.
- Stealth stance bar switch doesn't work, i removed it
